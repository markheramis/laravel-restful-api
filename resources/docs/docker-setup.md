# Docker Setup

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up Docker for your project, which we sometimes refer to as the Nothing else but Docker setup.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that your Docker environment is set up and installed. Follow the instructions provided in the Docker Documentation. If youâ€™re using Windows, follow these instructions to set up your Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) environment.

## Project Setup

### Installing Laravel Dependencies

If you have Composer installed, use the following command to install the Composer dependencies:

```
composer install
```

If you donâ€™t have Composer installed, you can install the Composer dependencies using the Docker Hub repository:

```
docker run --rm --interactive --tty --volume $PWD:/app --user $(id -u):$(id -g) composer install
```

### Configuring Laravel Sail

Before you start Sail, add Sail to your path. Refer to the Laravel Sail Documentation for instructions on configuring a bash alias to make sail available as a command.

### Starting Laravel Sail

Use the following command to start Laravel Sail:

```
sail up
```
Alternatively, you can use the following command, which performs the same action:

```
docker-compose up
```
Wait a few minutes for the setup script to run.

Congratulations! You should now have everything set up. To verify, please check the following services:

| Service    | Port | Web URL                                          |
| ---------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| App        | 8000 | [https://localhost:8000](https://localhost:8000) |
| MySQL      | 3306 | N/A                                              |
| PHPMyAdmin | 8080 | [https://localhost:8080](https://localhost:8080) |

## Testing

Given that the setup script automatically copies .env to .env.testing, you can immediately run tests using the artisan test command:

```
sail artisan test
```

This command will ensure that everything is working correctly in your Docker setup. If the tests pass, your setup is good to go! If not, youâ€™ll need to troubleshoot the issues based on the failed test cases.

Remember, the testing environment variables are set by the setup script, so thereâ€™s no need to manually copy the .env.testing.example file. This streamlines the testing process and helps you verify your setup more efficiently.

Happy testing! ðŸš€

## Documentation

To generate the API endpoint documentation, use the following command:

```
php artisan scribe:generate
```

Or, if youâ€™re using Sail:

```
sail artisan scribe:generate
```

Depending on your setup, the documentation will be available at one of the following URLs:

- Native: http://localhost:8000/docs/
- Sail/Docker: http://localhost/docs/
